# Finance AI Starter Kit

Welcome to the Finance AI Starter Kit! This project is designed to give you a head start in building modern financial applications with integrated Artificial Intelligence features. Leveraging the power of Next.js for a robust frontend, Firebase for a scalable backend, and Genkit for building AI workflows, this starter kit provides a solid foundation for your next FinTech project.

## Description

The Finance AI Starter Kit is a comprehensive template built with the following key technologies:

*   **Next.js:** A React framework for building performant and scalable web applications. It provides server-side rendering and static site generation capabilities.
*   **Firebase:** Google's mobile and web application development platform. This project utilizes Firebase for authentication, database (Firestore), and potentially other services as you expand.
*   **Genkit:** An open-source framework for building AI-powered applications. This starter kit includes example AI flows built with Genkit, such as a support chatbot, demonstrating how to integrate AI into your financial application.

This starter kit includes several pre-built components and pages to accelerate your development:

*   **Authentication:** User signup and login flows powered by Firebase Authentication.
*   **Dashboard:** A basic dashboard layout to display user-specific information.
*   **Market Data View:** Components to display market-related data (placeholder data or integrated with an external API).
*   **Portfolio View:** A section to potentially display a user's financial portfolio.
*   **Support Chatbot:** An example AI-powered chatbot built with Genkit to handle support queries.
*   **Admin Panel:** (Optional/Extendable) A basic structure for administrative tasks.

And many more UI components built with Shadcn UI.
